The code for PWM is found in this folder

Capabilities:

Two adjustable PWM signals for moving the car forward or reverse, called using Forward/Reverse functions.
Function for Left steering which outputs a continous signal set high (GPIO 3.3V)
Function for Right steering which outputs a continous signal set high (GPIO 3.3V)


The ADC is used to take readings from the POT and it is used to set the current Duty Cycle (speed of the car). ADC is triggered by TA1.1.

Testing specifications:
Compatible with LPM3, with XT1 -> ACLK

The following push buttons are used to drive the car:
P2.6 -> Reverse
P1.2 -> Forward
P1.3 -> Right
P1.4 -> Left

Output signals that control the H-bridge are found on the following pins:
P1.7 (PWMed) -> Forward
P1.6 (PWMed) -> Reverse
P1.6 (GPIO) -> Right
P5.0 (GPIO) -> Left

Requires Timer_A0 (TA0) in UP mode for the PWM signals generation and TA0CCR1 -> P1.7 | TA0CCR2 -> P1.6

GO TEAM!
