The code for PWM is found in this folder

Capabilities:

Two adjustable PWM signals for moving the car forward or backwards.
Easy testing of each mode (forward,backward,stop) using the MSP buttons
Easy adjustment of the Duty Cycle using the scaled value of ADCMEM0

Testing specifications:
Compatible with LPM3, with XT1 -> ACLK
Requires P1.7 | P1.6 as outputs for the two PWM signals
Requires P1.2 | P1.3 (SW1) | P1.4 (SW2) as inputs for choosing the direction. P1.2 = stop | P1.3 = FWD | P1.4 = RWD
Requires Timer_A0 (TA0) for the PWM signals generation and TA0CCR1 -> P1.7 | TA0CCR2 -> P1.6
